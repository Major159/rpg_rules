### The dungeon master

1. Appointing a substitute dungeon master with a 1 session story can reduce the chance of cancellation.

1. The dungeon master asks the players to prepare their character sheets in advance, before the *preparation time* of the first session. The dungeon master provides help if requested.

### Location

  1. Agree upon the softwares to be used, agreed upon *before the start of the game session*
  1. Required hardware, with network connection: a computer, wecam and micrphone or a smartphone.
1. Live
  1. Specify the available locations, and create an order of them so that every location will host the same amount of sessions. Must be agreed before the *preparation time* of the first session.
  1. If the next location becomes unavailable for any reason, then the next location in the agreed order takes its place.

### Players

1. At least 2 players are required, or a higher number requested by the dungeon master, agreed upon *before the start of the game session*
1. If the dungeon master requires that specific players to be present at the next session, she must say so *before  the start of the game session*. If she fails to do so, requirement conditions are not changed and the game session will take place.

### Accessories

1. Dice, everyone must have one of each of these: d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20. Dice rolling applications are not recommended.
1. A filled character sheet for each player.

## Cancellation

1. Game session is cancelled if any of the **Required conditions** listed are not met when starting the interval of *notification time*
1. Game session is cancelled if any of the **Required conditions** listed are lost within the interval of *notification time*. All members must be notified about this as soon as possible. If the game session still takes place, the points in the **Absence** section cannot be invoked on the absent players and the story of the game session cannot have any impact on the ongoing campaign.

## Declaring a new game session

1. Declaring the next session is the responsibility of the person who provides the location of the game.
1. Declaring the next session must be done before the double of the *notification time*, even if the day and time is agreed to repeat. This is to make sure everyone is aware that there will be a game session indeed.
1. The declaration of a new game session must contain:
  1. the day of the game
  1. the starting time, in 24 hour format
  1. location
  1. the name of the dungeon master (and her substitute, if available)
  1. name of the ongoing campaign
  1. A vote for the day of the game, as this seems the most problematic part. The voting options must contain the proposed day as well, and the person who does the declaration must vote right after the declaratio is done.
1. Each member must vote on the day of the game. If someone does not vote for anything *before the start of the game session*, she is considered unavailable.

## Absence

1. If someone is absent, her character will be passive during the game session and does not receive any experience points for the session.
1. If someone is absent, the dungeon master can take control of her character for the game session if the story requires it, but this must be made so that the character suffers the least possbile permanent changes.
